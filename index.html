  hi, i'm pie! i do art, i'm a d&d nerd, and i really like dogs. welcome to the commissions page!
  <div class="title">commissions</div>
  
  - payment preferably done through paypal, in SGD. will be requested through an invoice if you wish.<br>
  - a sketch will be provided, then once approved, i'll start work on the proper piece.<br>
  - time taken varies, depending on workload and general irl stuff.<br>
  - feel free to ask for status updates over the course of the commission! average time taken is a week, but more complicated pieces will take longer.<br>
  - once a piece is complete, i'll still fix up minor details / colour adjustments for free. if my style has somehow also changed a lot between the time of commission and present time, i don't mind redoing the piece for free once. if you're not sure, just ask!<br>
  - i <i>will</i> draw: characters from movies, comic books, etc; idols; original characters; animals; monsters.
 <br>
  - i <i>will not</i> draw: nsfw, mecha, anthromorphic animals, overly complicated outfits.
